## RGB Color Guessing Game

The project is a color guessing game based on the RGB color model written in vanilla JavaScript.

The rules are simple, choose the right color based on provided `RGB(red, green, blue)` and win the game. If you do not feel confident, switch to `easy` mode. If the game is too easy, choose the `hard` variant.
